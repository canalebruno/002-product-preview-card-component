## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### Continued development

- Am I using the HTML tags on their right place? Accessibility?
- When changing colour on hover, is better to change the colour hex or just use a brightness filter?
- For those images, is it better to use them as background on a div tag or as an image tag?
